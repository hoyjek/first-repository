            Robert Kiyosakiis a legendary figure who has changed the way how
            people look at money. An entrepreneur, investor, author and
            motivational speaker by profession, he audaciously is said to have
            commented that the reason why most of the people today are
            struggling financially is because despite years of formal education
            and training, they do not know anything about money. He is the
            author of the book, ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, which ever since the time
            of its release, scaled to become the number one personal finance
            book of all time. The book draws a comparison between his biological
            dad who was educated but poor and fictitious dad who was a college
            dropout but the wealthiest man in Hawaii. Today, a stalwart in his
            own right, this tycoon entrepreneur however had the most humble
            beginning. Interestingly, the man who has become a multi-millionaire
            teaching people how to become rich was himself a failure at one
            point of time and had twice gone bankrupt with his business
            ventures. However, he did not succumb to the downfall and instead
            started teaching people how not to become poor and evade erroneous
            financial decisions
